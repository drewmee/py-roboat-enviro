    "\n",
    "In the near future, the wrapper will be updated with object functionality to make everything super fluid - in the mean time, we can get by with this simple API wrapper with somewhat limited functionality and little documentation...\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Authentication\n",
    "\n",
    "To get started, you must first request an API Key. You can do so at https://www.roboat-enviro.com/api-keys. Once you have your API key, store it as an environment variable called *ROBOAT-ENVIRO_APIKEY**."

    "## Advanced Queries\n",
    "\n",
    "The API itself has quite powerful querying capabilites, though they can be a bit confusing to use at first. Eventually, I will get around to writing a \"helper\" function to make this as simple as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limit\n",
    "\n",
    "To limit the number of results you get for queries where a list of information is returned, you can add the `limit` keyword to your `params` dictionary. The argument must be an integer (i.e. `limit=5`.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Return the first five devices in the list:\n",
    "\n",
    "    >>> api.get_devices(params=dict(limit=5))\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Sort\n",
    "\n",
    "You can sort the order of results by any column and either by `asc` or `desc`. The format for the `sort` keyword must be `sort=\"[column],[asc or desc]\"`. You can also join multiple sorts together using a semicolon.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Return the first five devices, sorted asc by the last seen column:\n",
    "\n",
    "    >>> api.get_devices(params=dict(limit=5, sort=\"last_seen,asc\"))\n",

    "\n",
    "### Filter\n",
    "\n",
    "Filter is probably the most useful because it allows you to grab data between certain timestamps! There is also a ton of embedded functionality built in. The arguments that can be used include:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * `eq`: equals\n",
    "  * `ne`: not equals\n",
    "  * `lt`: less than\n",

    "  * `gt`: greater than\n",
    "  * `ge`: greater than or equal to\n",
    "  * `in`: in\n",
    "  * `like`: like\n",
    "  \n",
    "The format to the argument is as follows: `filter=\"[column],[arg],[value]\"`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "Grab data between May 1st and June 1st, 2018.\n",
    "\n",
